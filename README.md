# GATE2Salt

A library that maps GATE Documents and Corpora to SALT, a graph-based model for linguistic data (https://github.com/korpling/salt).
It is used in a sample pepper module (https://github.com/korpling/pepperModules-GateApiModules) and in the
GATE-Plugin GATE2Pepper (https://github.com/fab-bar/GATE_Plugin-GATE2Pepper).

It was created by Fabian Barteld and Florian Zipser.
